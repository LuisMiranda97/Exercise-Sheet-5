Directory Traversal
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/

This attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with "../" it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system. 

In this mission, first we access the previous index page, which the hacker left a clue where it was: oldindex.html.

https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html

Then we copy the source code of this page, and then access the submit poetry system.


On the "Name of poem" input field, we write "../index.html". Since /index.html is right now the hacked document, we access this directory through the exploit and put the new source code.

And then on the "Poem" input field, the source code we just copied. This way we restore the website by accessing the index.html and writing new code.
