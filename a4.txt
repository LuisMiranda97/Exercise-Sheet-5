SQL injection

Another Sql injection attack is the SQL injection union. This type of attacks are known to be used to extract information from the database.

In this mission, we are required to retrieve the email of the people registered in the mailing list. When we input a valid email, we just get a notification message. Otherwise, we get an error that it was not able to insert in the "email" table, which is giving us information of which table to retrieve.

Accessing either the fur coats or the alligator accessories, we notice that the url has a category parameter:

https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=1
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=2

For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:

The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

That is a query to the database to retrieve the information regarding the category.
Next we have to find out how many columns are there in this category. Through the Order By sql command we can find out the number of columns. Which is 4 columns.

Doing a union select we can craft a sql statement:
Select null, null,*,null from emails

Which we will retrieve the emails on the email table. Then all we do is send a message to SaveTheWhales with the hackthissite message system
